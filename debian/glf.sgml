<!-- Process this file with docbook-to-man to generate an nroff manual
     page: `docbook-to-man manpage.sgml > manpage.1'.  You may view
     the manual page with: `docbook-to-man manpage.sgml | nroff -man |
     less'.  A typical entry in a Makefile or Makefile.am is:

manpage.1: manpage.sgml
	docbook-to-man $< > $@

    
	The docbook-to-man binary is found in the docbook-to-man package.
	Please remember that if you create the nroff version in one of the
	debian/rules file targets (such as build), you will need to include
	docbook-to-man in your Build-Depends control field.
